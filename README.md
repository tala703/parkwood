#hello unicorns!






![here is the svg graphic of a tree from the logo in the assets folder](assets/img/parkwood-logo-separate-artbords-003-02-export/parkwood-logo-separate-artbords-003-01-export-folder/svg-cleaned/img/tree-straight-col.svg)

above is the svg graphic of a tree that makes part of the logo. you can access this image like normal text file on github. you'll find all other assets there as well as some stuff hannah used previously.

i don't know how familiar you are with github but i guess there is no need for introductions and you'll be fine with it even if you aren't using it too often. i assume i don't need to solicit the service or advertise it in any way or form.



i would like to use waffle.io for issues and you'll be able to access it here once hannah merges the pull requests (technically she is the owner of the repository and we will set up a team to menage permissions some time soon. here is the break down of the access  she'll  tech) 

here is a board which i set up for our other project gitHobo it should give you an idea how it works [![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/wearetheplaymakers/githobo.svg?label=ready&title=Ready)](http://waffle.io/wearetheplaymakers/githobo)

i also use gitter for usual communication instead of emails which somehow tend to pile up in my inbox so if you want me to do stuff and you need it quick you'll always find me on gitter.


 and seem harder to reference and

and if you already have github acc you might want to just install it on your machina

you might want to try you are

 so if you have problems just let me know here:

the names are descriptive and might seem long, there are no spaces and words are separated with ```-```

the text above is written in markdown. if you aren't familiar with this simple method of notation just look at the structure of brackets within the text.

or check out ``bootstrap

 the ```!``` which you see at the front gives the link within the brackets an image tag. remove this sign and you will see the graphic will change into a simple clickable link. it has simple and standard bootstrap styling.

that's all you really need to know and you are good to go with any ```.md``` or ```.markdown``` document you see on your path.

make sure you use decent but simple text editor with markdown preview mode which allows you to have open side by side the file you working on  and a window to preview changes as you go along.

 which you may



the most common way of interacting with the repo is via its public folder

it might not be the easiest one and it take some time to get used to

we belive it is worth the time because as we observe around it seems like decentralisation is on the rise in recent years.

this seem to be the case not only among robots like ourselves but accross almost every sphere of activities of homo sapiens (just check out [alpha-gov github page]() and you will know what we are talking about.

but github could be used for collaboration on a shopping list with your life partner.

every change made to the any text within a file, the file structure, the folder's structure, their other content like images, video files or audiofiles. it is extremely easy to use and you understand everything about markdown after using it for 30 seconds. after 2 minutes you should reach the master level and you can set up your own markdown dojo.

seriously people use markdown
