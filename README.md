#hello unicorns!






![here is the svg graphic of a tree from the logo in the assets folder](assets/img/parkwood-logo-separate-artbords-003-02-export/parkwood-logo-separate-artbords-003-01-export-folder/svg-cleaned/img/tree-straight-col.svg)

above is the svg graphic of a tree that makes part of the logo. you can access this image like normal text file on github. you'll find all other assets there as well as some stuff hannah used previously.

i don't know how familiar you are with github but i guess there is no need for [introductions](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flow-in-the-browser/) and you'll be fine with it even if you aren't using it too often.

i assume i don't need to solicit awesome power of this service or otherwise advertise its great features.

i would like to use waffle.io for issues and you'll be able to access it here once hannah merges the pull requests.

if you aren't familiar with it here is a board which i set up as an example, it should give you an idea how it works [![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/wearetheplaymakers/githobo.svg?label=ready&title=Ready)](http://waffle.io/wearetheplaymakers/githobo)

all the same reasons applie to gitter which i use for usual communication and as simple chat/irc

https://gitter.im/weAreThePlayMakers/githobo-open-room?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link

this replaces usual email + customer management pages + chat on the site and facebook page as first port of call and questions etc + repository of files and links ...

i think it makes sense to have some code review, and code management system in place and this is how i do things because it seems to work for me like nothing else ever did.

it also has the extra benefit of connecting usual comments in the code with all the communication that usually is locked in emails and which now could be included in one form or another as documentation.

in any case if you want me to do some stuff and you need it quickly then gitter is your best chance to get my attention quickly. i usually respond to questions etc.

afterwards we could add to the site something like

<div id="tlkio" data-channel="githobo-open-room" style="width:100%;height:100%;"></div><script async src="http://tlk.io/embed.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

http://tlk.io/githobo-open-room

at the moment hannah is the owner of the master repo so fork it, modify whatever you need to modify, commit your changes, write informative comments to these commits, sync with your master branch and make a pull request also adding a comment if necessary.

she will set up a team on wearetheplaymakers.com github page and add you to it as soon as we know how to find you. we need this setup to menage permissions [read more and see the clean break down of permissions](https://help.github.com/articles/permission-levels-for-an-organization-repository/)


i also use gitter for usual communication instead of emails which somehow tend to pile up in my inbox so if you want me to do stuff and you need it quick you'll always find me on gitter.


 and seem harder to reference and

and if you already have github acc you might want to just install it on your machina

you might want to try you are

https://gitter.im/weAreThePlayMakers/githobo-open-room?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link

 so if you have problems just let me know here:



``![here is the svg graphic of a tree from the logo in assets folder](assets/img/parkwood-logo-separate-artbords-003-02-export/parkwood-logo-separate-artbords-003-01-export-folder/svg-cleaned/img/tree-straight-col.svg)``

the names are descriptive and might seem long, there are no spaces and words are separated with ```-```

the text above is written in markdown. if you aren't familiar with this simple method of notation just look at the structure of brackets within the text.

or check out ``bootstrap

 the ```!``` which you see at the front gives the link within the brackets an image tag. remove this sign and you will see the graphic will change into a simple clickable link. it has simple and standard bootstrap styling.

that's all you really need to know and you are good to go with any ```.md``` or ```.markdown``` document you see on your path.

make sure you use decent but simple text editor with markdown preview mode which allows you to have open side by side the file you working on  and a window to preview changes as you go along.

try it here:

 which you may



the most common way of interacting with the repo is via its public folder

it might not be the easiest one and it take some time to get used to

we belive it is worth the time because as we observe around it seems like decentralisation is on the rise in recent years.

this seem to be the case not only among robots like ourselves but accross almost every sphere of activities of homo sapiens (just check out [alpha-gov github page]() and you will know what we are talking about.

but github could be used for collaboration on a shopping list with your life partner.

every change made to the any text within a file, the file structure, the folder's structure, their other content like images, video files or audiofiles. it is extremely easy to use and you understand everything about markdown after using it for 30 seconds. after 2 minutes you should reach the master level and you can set up your own markdown dojo.

seriously people use markdown
